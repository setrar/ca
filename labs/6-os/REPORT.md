# Lab 6

## User tasks

The code we use is:

```riscv
.global taskX
taskX:
    li   s0, 0
    li   s1, 10007
taskX_loop:
    beq  s0, s1, taskX_print
    addi s0, s0, 1
    b    taskX_loop
taskX_print:
    li   a7, 11
    li   a0, 'A'
    ecall
taskX_end:
    b    taskX
```

For clarity, we keep the `taskX_end`, but we could remove it (because we do not use a `b taskX_end`).

## Understanding the starting point of the mini-OS

### 6

The exception handler treats `ucause` as a signed integer. That way (after storing its value in an intermediate register), we only need to monitor its sign to know if it is an exception (>= 0) or an interrupt (< 0)

### 7

The handler select the message to show by computing the address of the message corresponding to the exception. It multiply the error code by 4 (32 bits) to get the address of the message in `_excp` and adds to it the address of `_excp`. That way it gets the address of the message to use with two simple computation.

### 8

For each exception, we only use the third strategy (the `ret` label). There is however, the second strategy also implemented in the code under the `skip` label.

### 9

The way the handler select the first instruction of the ISR to execute is the same as how the handler select the address of the message to show. It multiply the error code by 4 (using `slli` remove the need to care about the MSB, which we could not do if we were to use something like `mul t1, t0, 4`), and adds the address of the `_isr` array. It jumps to the address and each label choose which strategy to use.

### 10

In the *startup code* we store the address of the exception handler in `utvec`, enable interrupts, print "Hello, World!" and then quits.

## Call a user task, test an exception

### 4

We get the behaviour we expected: we print "Hello, World!" and then a continuous string of "A" that never stops (because `taskA` never quits).

### 6

I got the result I expected: print "Hello, World!", print a single "A", then quit the program.

```diff
    li   s1, 10007
+   la   s2, taskA
...
taskA_end:
-   b taskA
+   jalr t0, s2, 2
```

### 7

On the breakpoint:

- `sp`: `0x7fffeffc`
- `pc`: `0x00400174`
- `t0`: `0x00400000`
- `t1`: `0x00000000`

Exception handler:

- `ustatus`: `0x00000010`, in exception handler, so bit 0 (was 1) copied to bit 4 and cleared.
- `utvec`: `0x00400000`, equal to t0, the address of the exception handler.
- `uepc`: `0x0040014a`, address of the `jalr` (in `taskA`) instruction.
- `ucause`: `0x00000000`, exception (MSB = 0) and instruction address misaligned (bit 31-0 = 0).

## Add a timer ISR

### 6 & 8

We get the expected behaviour: every 100ms we have a `*` printed between the `A` or `B`.

## Context switch

### 1

The registers that constitute a running task are: `s0`, `s1`, `a0`, `a7`, and we also need to save the address of the instruction that was running when the interrupt was raised. However, it may not be needed to save `s1`, `a0`, and `a7` as they do not change over time.  
Depending on the implementation of `taskX`, it may not be needed to load `a0` and `a7`, as they could be loaded just before the `ecall`.  
Because `a7` is used by both tasks, we don't even need to save it, as the exception handler save (line 48 is os.s) and restore (line 147) it for us.

We can also consider that the labels used are part of a running task. But we cannot really save them.

### 2

Considering that task change every 100ms, we need a very fast access time, so the values should be saved in memory. If we were able to decide, it would be even better to save them in the CPU cache, on the first level. We would need only less than half a kilobyte to save the two tasks.

### 3

For the same reason as 2, the data structures should be saved if possible in the CPU cache with preferences for level 1, but the memory works as well.  
As for the data structure itself, I think a simple array of 10 continuous elements (4 bytes each) would suffice. We would store the address of the first element in a register, and add 20 to it to go to the other task (and then subtract 20 to go back to the first).

### 7

The behaviour is as expected. We get 3 'A' for 1 'B' as B need very close to 3 times the incrementation of A, and a lot of * between each letter, as we switch every 100ms to the other task, we lose time.

## Relaxing the constraints

### 1

In the current version, we keep track of the running task using the value of `s3` (0 for taskA, 1 for taskB). We can use the same thing but with more possible value (as many values as we have tasks we want to run). Of course, this means that it would be a round-robin scheduler (we can't do much else without spending far more time than reasonable).

We can use `t0` as the pointer to the start of the 5 correct value in the memory (`s2` had this function previously, but now `s2` should never change). To get it, we only need to multiply the current value of `s3` by 20 (4 * 5) to get the correct address to store the context.  
Now, we can add 1 to s3, and either it is equal to the number of task, at which point we did a whole round of tasks (because task 1 is 0, task 2 is 1, etc.) and we set `s3` to 0; or it is not, and we can continue as is.  
Again we multiply s3 by 20, and we can restore the context of the next task.

However, there is downside to it. Here we can always multiply by 20 because all save and restore 5 different values. But we are not sure if it will always be the case, in a real OS, we may need to restore 4.2Â GB of data. The current way would allocate the same size for all tasks (which is vastly overkill for most applications).  
We could solve it by using different size for apps, along with pointing to some sort of memory inode that would tell us if we should go deeper or not.

We will need to change a little the code that restores the task context, but nothing big. Here is an example with 25 tasks:

```riscv
  li     t2, 20           # stores 4 * number of word to save and restore (here 5)
  mul    t0, s3, t2       # get address of first correct value in the list
  add    t0, s2, t0       # stores in t0 the address of the correct value in the whole memory

    # [stores the values with t0 as the start]

  li     t1, 25           # store number of tasks
  addi   s3, s3, 1
  bneq   s3, t1, restore  # if next task is not equal to number of tasks, we can restore as is
completed_a_round:
  li     s3, 0
  b restore
restore:
  mul    t0, s3, t2
  add    t0, s2, t0

    # [restore the value from the saved part (with t0)]
```

I am not showing the initialization of the `tasks` part, but it is just like in [os_3](./os_3.s) (with 25 part instead of 2).

### 2

We could use a register lets say `a1` we would be 0 when the task in not finished and 1 when it is. (We also need to save and restore it in the context when switching tasks.) We could then create a loop around `addi s3 s3 1` and `add t0, s2, t0` (the second) than would restore the value of `a1` and take decision based on it.  
If it is zero, continue like before, restore the rest of the registers, return from the exception handler, live a happy life.  
However, if it is not, we would then go back to before the `addi s3 s3 1` and do the loop until either we find a `a1` that is not 1, or until we tried all the tasks.

```diff
    # [start like before]

+  li     t3, 0
+make_sure_correct
+  bneq   t3, t1, do_not_quit
+  li     a7, 10      # if t3 is equal to number of tasks, then quit
+  ecall
+do_not_quit:
  addi   s3, s3, 1
  bneq   s3, t1, restore
completed_a_round:
  li     s3, 0
  b restore
restore:
  mul    t0, s3, t2
  add    t0, s2, t0
+  addi   t3, t3, 1
+  lw     a1, t0
+  bnez   a1, make_sure_correct

    # [continue like before]
```

In the example, we modified the `tasks` definition such that `a1` is stored in the first position, and not the address of the task.

### 3

In the exception handler, rather than autonomously incrementing the value of `s3` by 1, we could ask the user for an input, and following some rules, stop or start some tasks.  
For example, we could print the task list and if they are stopped or running. Then the user would either enter the number of a task to launch it, or do the same with a minus (-) sign in front to stop it.

Or during each task iteration, we could raise an interrupt, look if there was a number entered by the user. If yes, we switch to this task, else we continue running the previous one.
