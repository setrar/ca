## The time-out flag



${\color{Salmon} 1.}$ Edit the `io.s` source file. In the data section add a declaration for a 32-bits word that we will use for the time-out flag, with a global label for easy reference:

```asm
# time-out flag
.global time_out
time_out:
.word 0
```

${\color{Salmon} 2.}$ Add a `set_timer` function that takes a delay in milliseconds in register a0 but does nothing and returns.
Later we will modify it to initialize a timer.

```asm
# code section
.text

# function: set_timer
# description: sets the timers initial values
# parameters: none
# return: nothing for now
# notes: ret is a pseudo-instruction
set_timer:
    addi  sp,sp,-32          # allocate stack frame
    sw    ra,0(sp)           # save ra

    la t0, time_out
    sw zero, 0(t0)           

    lw    ra,0(sp)           # restore ra
    addi  sp,sp,32           # deallocate stack frame, restore stack pointer    
    ret                      # Return
```

${\color{Salmon} 3.}$ At the beginning of `getc` and `putc` functions call `set_timer` with parameter 5000 (5 seconds) and reset the time-out flag.

```asm
    li a0, 5000              # Call set_timer with parameter 5000 (5 seconds)
    call set_timer
    la t0, time_out
    sw zero, 0(t0)           # Reset the time-out flag to 0
```

4. Modify the polling loops of `getc` and `putc` such that they watch the time-out flag and return error code 4 in `a1` if the value of the time-out flag is not 0.

5. Adapt the code of the `print_string`, `geti` and `puti` functions such that they handle this new error code and return it to their own caller functions, still in `a1`.
For all functions check that they return value 0 in `a1` if there is no error.

6. Adapt the code of the `main` function such that it prints a dedicated error message and exits if there is a time-out error.
Of course, do not check for another time-out error while printing the dedicated error message.
Do you understand why we use values 1, 2 and 4 for the error codes, and not 1, 2 and 3?


7. Assemble with RARS, launch the `Keyboard and Display MMIO simulator` tool, connect it to the program, simulate, debug if needed and verify that it behaves as expected.
As we have no way yet to set the time-out flag during the simulation we are not be able to really test the time-out feature; the new version shall behave as the original one.

## The timer tool

&#x1F5E3; Answers:

1. Launch the Timer Tool, connect it to the running program, start the timer, wait a few seconds and pause it.

2. In the Data Segment sub-window of RARS select the 0xffff0000 (MMIO) memory region and look at the current value of time.

3. Does it correspond to the current time of the Timer Tool window?

Yes, `5761 ms` seems to match the `00:05.61` value 

4. Modify the io.s code

```asm
# TBD
```

5. Assemble with RARS,

```asm
# TBD
```

In RISC-V, `mstatus` and `ustatus` are control and status registers (CSRs) that store information about the processor's operating state. The main difference between them is their scope and the privilege level at which they operate:

1. **`mstatus` (Machine Status Register):**
   - **Scope:** `mstatus` is a machine-level CSR, meaning it holds information about the entire processor.
   - **Privilege Level:** It is accessible in machine mode, which is the highest privilege level in RISC-V.
   - **Usage:** `mstatus` includes bits that control machine-level interrupt enable/disable (`MIE`), machine-level interrupt delegation (`MIDELEG`), machine-level privilege mode (`MPP`), and other machine-level status bits.

2. **`ustatus` (User Status Register):**
   - **Scope:** `ustatus` is a user-level CSR, and it holds information specific to a user-level (non-privileged) program or task.
   - **Privilege Level:** It is accessible in user mode, which is the lowest privilege level in RISC-V.
   - **Usage:** `ustatus` includes bits that control user-level interrupt enable/disable (`UIE`), user-level interrupt delegation (`UIDELEG`), and user-level privilege mode (`UPRIV`).

Here's a brief overview of the key bits in both registers:

- **`mstatus` (Machine Status Register):**
  - `MIE`: Machine Interrupt Enable
  - `MPIE`: Machine Previous Interrupt Enable
  - `MPP`: Machine Previous Privilege Mode
  - `MIDELEG`: Machine Interrupt Delegation
  - Other machine-level status and control bits.

- **`ustatus` (User Status Register):**
  - `UIE`: User Interrupt Enable
  - `UPIE`: User Previous Interrupt Enable
  - `UPRIV`: User Privilege Mode
  - `UIDELEG`: User Interrupt Delegation
  - Other user-level status and control bits.

In summary, `mstatus` is used to manage the machine-level state and privilege levels of the entire processor, while `ustatus` is specifically for managing the state of a user-level program. The specific bits and their meanings may vary depending on the RISC-V specification version and extensions used. Always refer to the RISC-V architecture manual for precise details.
